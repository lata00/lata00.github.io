"Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our civilization is decadent and our language — so the argument runs — must inevitably share in the general collapse."<br><br>
(Chapter:Politics and the English Language)<br><br> 
"Underneath this lies the half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes."<br><br>

"A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks."<br><br>

"It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts."<br><br> 
(Chapter:Politics and the English Language)<br><br> 
"Each of these passages has faults of its own, but, quite apart from avoidable ugliness, two qualities are common to all of them. The first is staleness of imagery; the other is lack of precision. The writer either has a meaning and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something else, or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not. This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political writing. "<br><br>

"prose consists less and less of words chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of phrases tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house"<br><br> 
(Chapter:Politics and the English Language)<br><br> 
"Except for the useful abbreviations i. e., e. g. and etc., there is no real need for any of the hundreds of foreign phrases now current in the English language."<br><br> 
(Chapter:Politics and the English Language)<br><br> 
"Words like romantic, plastic, values, human, dead, sentimental, natural, vitality, as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly ever expected to do so by the reader. When one critic writes, ‘The outstanding feature of Mr. X's work is its living quality’, while another writes, ‘The immediately striking thing about Mr. X's work is its peculiar deadness’, the reader accepts this as a simple difference opinion."<br><br>

"The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies ‘something not desirable’."<br><br> 
(Chapter:Politics and the English Language)<br><br> 
"As I have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug. The attraction of this way of writing is that it is easy. It is easier — even quicker, once you have the habit — to say In my opinion it is not an unjustifiable assumption that than to say I think. If you use ready-made phrases, you not only don't have to hunt about for the words; you also don't have to bother with the rhythms of your sentences since these phrases are generally so arranged as to be more or less euphonious.

"In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible"<br><br> 
(Chapter:Politics and the English Language)<br><br> 
"Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness."<br><br> 
(Chapter:Politics and the English Language)<br><br> 
"The great enemy of clear language is insincerity"<br><br> 
(Chapter:Politics and the English Language)<br><br> 
"In our age there is no such thing as ‘keeping out of politics’. All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred, and schizophrenia"<br><br> 
(Chapter:Politics and the English Language)<br><br> 
"This invasion of one's mind by ready-made phrases (lay the foundations, achieve a radical transformation) can only be prevented if one is constantly on guard against them, and every such phrase anaesthetizes a portion of one's brain."<br><br> 
(Chapter:Politics and the English Language)<br><br> 
"What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way around."<br><br> 
(Chapter:Politics and the English Language)<br><br> 
"Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and get one's meaning as clear as one can through pictures and sensations."<br><br> 
(Chapter:Politics and the English Language)<br><br> 
"Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print. Never use a long word where a short one will do. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out. Never use the passive where you can use the active. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous."<br><br>
