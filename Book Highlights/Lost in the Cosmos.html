"One of the peculiar ironies of being a human self in the Cosmos: A stranger approaching you in the street will in a second’s glance see you whole, size you up, place you in a way in which you cannot and never will, even though you have spent a lifetime with yourself, live in the Century of the Self, and therefore ought to know yourself best of all."

"The self is an individual entity created by God and endowed with certain inalienable rights and the freedom to pursue happiness and fulfill its potential. It achieves itself through work, participation in society, family, the marketplace, the political process, cultural activities, sports, the sciences, and the arts. It follows that in a free and affluent society the self should succeed more often than not in fulfilling itself. Happiness can be pursued and to a degree caught."

"It is better to seek help from a psychotherapist if the psychotherapist knows what not many psychotherapists know, namely, that the shy person may know something the non-shy person does not know, that your self is indeed unformulable to yourself, that you are entitled to your shyness, that, indeed, varying degrees of idiocy are required not to be shy, that the very unformulability of your self is the only clue you have to the uniqueness of yourself, that otherwise one will become yet another Ralph among a thousand Ralphs, or worse still, become an imitation of the psychotherapist."

(b) Putatively bad but secretly not so bad: I don’t know anybody in Omaha and there is something extremely interesting about an authenticated UFO visitation—which I had never really credited until now."
(Chapter:(9) The Envious Self)
 <p> 
"Is it because the self first had the means of understanding itself through myth, albeit incorrectly, later understood itself through religion as a creature of God, and now has the means of understanding the Cosmos through positive science but not itself because the self cannot be grasped by positive science, and that therefore the self can perceive itself only as a ghost in a machine? How else can a ghost feel otherwise toward a machine than bored?"

"Now, call into question the unspoken assumption: something is wrong with you. Like Copernicus and Einstein, turn the universe upside down and begin with a new assumption. Assume that you are quite right. You are depressed because you have every reason to be depressed. No member of the other two million species which inhabit the earth—and who are luckily exempt from depression—would fail to be depressed if it lived the life you lead. You live in a deranged age—more deranged than usual, because despite great scientific and technological advances, man has not the faintest idea of who he is or what he is doing."

"And you, an ex-suicide, lying on the beach? In what way have you been freed by the serious entertainment of your hypothetical suicide? Are you not free for the first time in your life to consider the folly of man, the most absurd of all the species, and to contemplate the comic mystery of your own existence? And even to consider which is the more absurd state of affairs, the manifest absurdity of your predicament: lost in the Cosmos and no news of how you got into such a fix or how to get out—or the even more preposterous eventuality that news did come from the God of the Cosmos, who took pity on your ridiculous plight and entered the space and time of your insignificant planet to tell you something."

(Chapter:A Semiotic Primer of the Self)
 <p> 
"The fateful flaw of human semiotics is this: that of all the objects in the entire Cosmos which the sign-user can apprehend through the conjoining of signifier and signified (word uttered and thing beheld), there is one which forever escapes his comprehension—and that is the sign-user himself. Semiotically, the self is literally unspeakable to itself. One cannot speak or hear a word which signifies oneself, as one can speak or hear a word signifying anything else, e.g., apple, Canada, 7-Up. The self of the sign-user can never be grasped, because, once the self locates itself at the dead center of its world, there is no signified to which a signifier can be joined to make a sign. The self has no sign of itself. No signifier applies. All signifiers apply equally. You are Ralph to me and I am Walker to you, but you are not Ralph to you and I am not Walker to me. (Have you ever wondered why the Ralphs you know look as if they ought to be called Ralph and not Robert?) For me, certain signifiers fit you, and not others. For me, all signifiers fit me, one as well as another. I am rascal, hero, craven, brave, treacherous, loyal, at once the secr"

(Chapter:A Semiotic Primer of the Self)
 <p> 
"The impoverishment of the immanent self derives from a perceived loss of sovereignty to “them,” the transcending scientists and experts of society. As a consequence, the self sees its only recourse as an endless round of work, diversion, and consumption of goods and services. Failing this and having some inkling of its plight, it sees no way out because it has come to see itself as an organism in an environment and so can’t understand why it feels so bad in the best of all possible environments—say, a good family and a good home in a good neighborhood in East Orange on a fine Wednesday afternoon—and so finds itself secretly relishing bad news, assassinations, plane crashes, and the misfortunes of neighbors, and even comes secretly to hope for catastrophe, earthquake, hurricane, wars, apocalypse—anything to break out of the iron grip of immanence."

"His assistant, a tall striking blonde, a graduate student from Berkeley who shares the scientist’s every interest but one: she is deeply and frantically in love with him and therefore is both miserable for fear he may not love her and also ecstatically transcendent toward the crowd of tourists, feeling sorry for them not only because they have been transcended but also because they are not in love."

"A young Pueblo Indian dancer, a sophomore at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, a major in business administration, a promising basketball forward, for whom it goes without saying that the cosmological myths of his tribe are just that, myths, to be taken no more seriously than what he considers the Judaeo-Christian myths of the Catholic Church in which he was baptized. He joined the Newman Club of U. of N.M. to meet girls and did. It is with a complex good-natured irony that he paints his body and dons the costume and enters into the Corn Dance, an irony compounded of a gentle forbearance toward his elders and a sardonic contempt for the camera-clicking Anglos and tourists. He can also use the money he’ll make from the photography fees."

"The scientist understands both and thinks that each is right in his own way. He sees the psychological “truth” of the cosmological myths of the old dancer. He sees the value of the skepticism of the young dancer.

(a) Sagan is lonely because, as a true devotee of science, a noble and reliable method of attaining knowledge, he feels increasingly isolated in a world in which, as Bronowski has said, there is a failure of nerve and men seem willing to undertake anything other than the rigors of science and believe anything at all: in Velikovsky, von Daniken, even in Mr. and Mrs. Barney Hill, who reported being captured and taken aboard a spacecraft in Vermont. (b) Sagan is lonely because, after great expectations, he has not discovered ETIs in the Cosmos, because chimpanzees don’t talk, dolphins don’t talk, humpback whales sing only to other humpback whales, and he has heard nothing but random noise from the Cosmos, and because Vikings 1 and 2 failed to discover evidence of even the most rudimentary organic life in the soil of Mars. (c) Sagan is lonely because, once everything in the Cosmos, including man, is reduced to the sphere of immanence, matter in interaction, there is no one left to talk to except other transcending intelligences from other worlds."

"“Demoniac” implies possession of the soul by an unbenign spirit.

"Social life is disappointing. The very franticness of attempts to reestablish community and festival, by partying, by group, by club, by touristy Mardi Gras, is the best evidence of the loss of true community and festival and of the loneliness of self, stranded as it is as an unspeakable consciousness in a world from which it perceives itself as somehow estranged, stranded even within its own body, with which it sees no clear connection."

"The assumption was made that as organisms evolve in the Cosmos, a level of intelligence will be reached so that it will be possible to transmit information. Mathematics and science might be used as the basis of a common language. Mathematics is the same everywhere. The prime numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 … are prime everywhere. The physics of the Cosmos is the same. For example, since hydrogen is the most abundant atom in the Cosmos, one might use the proton and electron spin of the neutral hydrogen atom as the binary number 1. Using such a binary system, the project designers hoped that it might be possible to establish a vocabulary and transmit information about the earth and its star, for example, its position in relation to the fourteen major pulsars of the galaxy, and to put similar questions to other intelligences."

"EARTHSHIP: True. Very interesting. We read. Request permission to land. We could exchange much more information by meeting and talking. PC3: Not quite yet. You haven’t answered our question about C-type. EARTHSHIP: What do you mean by type of consciousness? PC3: We are C1s. We wanted to know whether you are C1s or C2s or C3s. EARTHSHIP: What is a C1? PC3 (patiently): We told you. C = 1 (Int, Soc, Sy). EARTHSHIP: What does that mean? PC3 (patiently): It means that in order for the individual consciousness to be activated, it is required that there be a Soc, that is, a society, that is, two or more persons; an exchange of Sy, that is, symbols; and an Int, that is, an intersubjective relationship in which there is agreement about the symbol used and the thing that is talked about. EARTHSHIP: Oh. PC3: And you? EARTHSHIP: We’re much the same. Now may we request permission to— PC3: Just a moment. It is still necessary to establish your C-type. We are C1s, that is, first-order consciousness. Through the centuries we have learned by painful experience that there are at least two other C-types, C2s and C3s. C1s and C3s are benign. C2s are dangerous. Which are you? EARTHSHIP: Say again. What’s the difference? PC3: A C1 consciousness is a first-order consciousness, or what you would call a preternatural consciousness—according to the dictionary your computer transmitted. EARTHSHIP: It is? Say again. Preternatural? PC3: Well, something like the consciousness of a child grown mature and sophisticated but maintaining its innocence permanently and avoiding the malformations of self-consciousness, enjoying the beauty of our planet and each other and our science and art without weariness, boredom, fear, guilt, or shame. Like what you call the Helen Keller phenomenon. EARTHSHIP: How do you know about her? PC3: One of our cosmological linguists just arrived. This is he speaking. We’ve been monitoring you for years. Switch to Earth-L, English-speaking? German? French? EARTHSHIP: American English. PC3: Got it. I read. What can we do for you? EARTHSHIP: What do you mean by the Helen Keller phenomenon? PC3: The joy of consciousness and the discovery of the Cosmos through the mediation of symbols and the cooperation of others and the preservation of this joy against the incursions of boredom, fear, anger, despair, shame, and the love of war and death and the secret desire for the misfortune of others. EARTHSHIP: Check. Did you say shame? PC3: We have observed that C2s experience shame. For example, do you wear clothes? EARTHSHIP: Yes. PC3: Despite the controlled environment of your ship? EARTHSHIP: Yes. PC3: Why? EARTHSHIP: Ah, custom. Aesthetics. PC3: Aesthetics? Explain. EARTHSHIP: Later, when we land. May we land? PC3: Not yet. What is your C-type? EARTHSHIP: What is a C2 consciousness? PC3: A C2 consciousness is a consciousness which passes through a C1 stage and then for some reason falls into the pit of itself. EARTHSHIP: The pit of itself? PC3: In some evolving civilizations, for reasons which we don’t entirely understand, the evolution of consciousness is attended by a disaster of some sort which occurs shortly after the Sy breakthrough. It has something to do with the discovery of the self and the incapacity to deal with it, the consciousness becoming self-conscious but not knowing what to do with the self, not even knowing what its self is, and so ending by being that which it is not, saying that which is not, doing that which is not, and making others what they are not. EARTHSHIP: What does that mean? PC3: Playing roles, being phony, lying, cheating, stealing, and killing. To say nothing of exotic disordering of the reproductive apparatus of sexual creatures. EARTHSHIP: What does that mean? PC3: Exploitative sex. EARTHSHIP: Exploitative sex? PC3 (consulting computerized earth-slang dictionary): It seems to mean what you call “screwing everything in sight,” not only   to   and   to   but   to   and   to   and   +   +   and   +   +  —to mention a few of the simpler combinations. EARTHSHIP: That is what is called “freedom of sexual preference.” PC3: Call it what you like. We are not interested. What concerns us is our experience with C2s whom we have allowed to land on PC3. They are usually polite at first, but always turn hostile, deceptive, and end by attempting to screw (is that the right word?) any creatures on PC3 which have an opening or a protuberance. We could tolerate their odd sexual behavior, but they were also sentimental and cruel—or rather sentimental, therefore cruel. One goes with the other. They are mainly interested in self-esteem. We are afraid of C2s. They do not know themselves or what to do with themselves. EARTHSHIP: What about you? What do you do about your consciousness and your selves? PC3: That is no problem. For us, consciousness of self is no different from consciousness of anything else. A self here is an individual self yet also a self among other selves. C2 selves vary from moment to moment from self-grandiosity to self-refusal, from being the infinite great self in the world to being the worst and the least self—because C2 selves don’t know who they are.* Perhaps your difficulty comes from the sensory mode which you call “seeing.” You “see” things. But can you “see” yourself? Who are you? EARTHSHIP: I’m the second officer, the communications officer. PC3: No, I mean, who are you? EARTHSHIP: You mean my name? Captain— PC3 (patiently): No. Let’s begin with C-type. What’s your C-type? Are you C1, C2, or C3? You will not be given permission to descend until we establish that. EARTHSHIP (after a pause): What’s a C3 consciousness? PC3: A C3 consciousness is a C2 consciousness which has become aware of its predicament, sought help, and received it. EARTHSHIP: Help? PC3: If a C1 meets with disaster, falls into the pit of itself, and becomes a C2, it must become aware of its sickness and seek a remedy in order to be restored to the preternaturality of Cl. Well? EARTHSHIP: Well what? PC3: Which are you? EARTHSHIP: That is hard to say. PC3: Perhaps we can help you arrive at an answer. Would you answer a few questions? EARTHSHIP: Yes. PC3: You say your civilization has five superpowers. EARTHSHIP: Yes. PC3: Is there peace between you? EARTHSHIP: There was when we left. PC3: Aren’t you in communication with Earth? EARTHSHIP: We were until two years ago. PC3: Isn’t that strange? EARTHSHIP: Yes. PC3: Then you have reason to believe something is wrong on Earth? EARTHSHIP: Yes. (Quickly) Do you know anything? PC3: (evasively): Let’s get on with the questions. How many wars have you had in the last hundred earth-years? EARTHSHIP: Big or little? PC3: Well, big. EARTHSHIP: Two—that we know of. Do you know of a third? PC3: How many lives were terminated before their natural C2 deaths? EARTHSHIP: You mean how many were killed? PC3: Yes. EARTHSHIP: Around a hundred million. PC3: Now you fear there might have been a third. EARTHSHIP: Yes. Do you know? PC3: What is the size of your crew? EARTHSHIP: Twelve in the beginning. PC3: How many of each sex? EARTHSHIP: Six. PC3: How did you arrive at the sexual distribution? EARTHSHIP: We felt that sexual needs must be taken into account, just like the needs for food, water, a stable environment, and so on. And though none of us has any prejudice against homosexuality, we were not yet sure enough of the dynamics of a homosexual group to take chances with the mission. PC3: Is there pair bonding among you? EARTHSHIP: No. Ours was designed as a communal and transcultural group interaction. Through extensive prelaunch exercises, we discovered we could get beyond the usual cultural and sexual hang-ups. PC3: How has it worked? EARTHSHIP: Among the nine survivors, very well until just recently. PC3: Nine survivors? What happened to the other three? EARTHSHIP (after a silence): They died. PC3: Were they killed? EARTHSHIP: Yes. PC3: Were they men? EARTHSHIP: Yes. PC3: Were they killed in quarrels over the women? EARTHSHIP: Yes. How did you know? PC3: We’ve had some experience with C2s. How are things now? EARTHSHIP: Fine. Each man has two women. We think we’ve made a valuable contribution to prolonged heterosexual group dynamics. PC3: What’s that? EARTHSHIP: Men are less monogamous than women. Men are happier with more than one woman, and the women don’t seem to mind, once they’ve gotten past cultural hang-ups. PC3: Interesting. Now, you say you’re the second officer. EARTHSHIP: Yes. PC3: Can I speak to the commander? EARTHSHIP: I’m afraid not. PC3: You mean, the commander didn’t survive. EARTHSHIP: He survived, but he’s, ah, ill. PC3: What’s wrong with him? EARTHSHIP: He’s out of it. Flaked out. He sniffs coke and reads Rod McKuen and Richard Bach. He’s not functioning. We need to land. Request permission. PC3: Did you say two women are assigned to each man? EARTHSHIP: Not assigned. That’s the way it worked out. At first. PC3: What happened? For example, what about the commander’s two women? EARTHSHIP: They’re okay. When he lost interest, they turned to each other. They have a relationship. PC3: Who is the other officer? EARTHSHIP: He’s the exec. PC3: What’s he doing? EARTHSHIP: Screwing his brains out. PC3: What about you? EARTHSHIP: I’m too damn busy flying this ship. Request— PC3: Then you’re in trouble. EARTHSHIP: Yes. We have to land before we even consider returning. PC3: No, I mean your species is in trouble. You don’t even know whether you have a civilization, and the chances are you do not. EARTHSHIP: That is correct. PC3: My question is this. Clearly, you are a C2. We need to know how you stand vis-à-vis your predicament, that is, knowledge of it and remedy for it. E.g., do you have such knowledge? Have you requested help? Has help arrived? Did you accept help? EARTHSHIP: Help? What help? We don’t ask for help. We help ourselves. We are the triumphant emerging species on our planet, and though we are not as far advanced as you, we are not ashamed of our scientific and technological and artistic achievements. If we were not a tough, self-sufficient, inquisitive species, we wouldn’t be here. PC3: Then help was not requested and has not arrived? EARTHSHIP: Are you talking about religion? If so, I can only reply that we have progressed beyond sectarianism—which caused many of the troubles you speak of. We have selected many of the values of the World’s Great Religions—such as meditation, caring, sharing, interpersonal warmth, creativity—and we have rejected sectarian claims of exclusivity and anthropomorphic gods. PC3: I see. Any other immediate troubles? EARTHSHIP: My two women are fighting. Both were thought to be culturally liberated and were so certified by the screening procedure. But one has reverted to the old monogamy and wants the captain to marry us. The other one wants to screw the captain and me at the same time and also run the ship. (Sotto voce conversation near PC3 transmitter overheard by earthship officer who has learned a bit of PC linguistics, and of which he can make out only: “—My God, we need these people like a [word not understood]—Get them out of here—”) EARTHSHIP: I’m sure the difficulties of these women are not genetic and would not present a problem for you. One is undergoing a neurotic regression, the other a manic-erotic episode. I’m afraid our screening procedure was inadequate. The goddam shrinks screwed up as usual. PC3 (sorrowfully): Permission denied. Please resume your mission or return. EARTHSHIP (frantically): We can’t return. There is nothing to return to. PC3: That is correct.

"Though he might appear as stolid and as steady as one of the old astronauts or a commercial airline pilot—even a little dumb—in fact he was very much conscious of doing just that: playing the unflappable captain. It was his complex way to make the untoward odd decision and to take pleasure both in savoring the very oddness of it and in sticking to it"

"he believed that there is no end to the mischief and hatred which men harbor deep in themselves and unknown to themselves and no end to their capacity to deceive themselves and that though they loved life, they probably loved death more and in the end thanatos would likely win over eros. "

"Repeat. Do you read? Do you read? Are you in trouble? How did you get in trouble? If you are in trouble, have you sought help? If you did, did help come? If it did, did you accept it?
