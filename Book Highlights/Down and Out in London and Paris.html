<h1> Chapter I

<h4> The Paris slums are a gathering-place for eccentric people–people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent

<h4> Bad luck seemed to have turned him half-witted in a single day

<h1> Chapter II

<h4> Alas, but I am past the time when I could know such happiness as that. It is gone for ever–the very possibility, even the desire for it, are gone

<h4> She was some peasant girl, doubtless, whom her parents had sold into slavery.

<h1> Chapter III

<h4> Hitherto I had not thought about the future, but I now realised that I must do something at once

<h4> Your hair wants cutting, and you try to cut it yourself, with such fearful results that you have to go to the barber after all

<h4> You have strayed into a respectable quarter, and you see a prosperous friend coming. To avoid him you dodge into the nearest café

<h4> Once in the café you must buy something, so you spend your last fifty centimes on a glass of black coffee with a dead fly in it

<h4> You discover the boredom which is inseparable from poverty; the times when you have nothing to do and, being underfed, can interest yourself in nothing

<h4> You discover that a man who has gone even a week on bread and margarine is not a man any longer, only a belly with a few accessory organs

<h4> It would have been a pleasure to flatten the Jew’s nose, if only one could have afforded it

<h4> And there is another feeling that is a great consolation in poverty. I believe everyone who has been hard up has experienced it. It is a feeling of relief, almost of pleasure, at knowing yourself at last genuinely down and out

<h4> You have talked so often of going to the dogs–and well, here are the dogs, and you have reached them, and you can stand it. It takes off a lot of anxiety.

<h1> Chapter IV

<h4> One went through grandiose stone portals (marked, of course, ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité’–they write that even over the police stations in France)

<h4> Afterwards, when it was too late, I learned that it is wiser to go to a pawnshop in the afternoon. The clerks are French, and, like most French people, are in a bad temper till they have eaten their lunch.

<h1> Chapter V

<h4> Name of Jesus Christ!’ he exclaimed, ‘oh, name of Jesus Christ, my back! Curse it, I believe my back is broken!’
‘What’s the matter?’ I exclaimed.
‘My back is broken, that is all. I have spent the night on the floor. Oh, name of Jesus Christ! If you knew what my back feels like

<h4> We shan’t starve, don’t you fear. This is only the fortune of war–I’ve been in a worse hole scores of times. It’s only a question of persisting

<h4> Tomorrow we shall find something, mon ami, I know it in my bones. The luck always changes. Besides, we both have brains–a man with brains can’t starve

<h1> Chapter VI

<h4> One day, I remember, we crossed the Seine eleven times

<h1> Chapter VII

<h4> I spent the day in bed, reading the Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. It was all that I felt equal to, without food. Hunger reduces one to an utterly spineless, brainless condition

<h1> Chapter X

<h4> Then the chef du personnel took me to a tiny underground den–a cellar below a cellar, as it were–where there were a sink and some gas-ovens. It was too low for me to stand quite upright, and the temperature was perhaps 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

<h4> To me, twisting your neck would be no more than spitting on the floor. And if there’s any trouble, they’ll believe me, not you. So be careful

<h4> The kitchen was like nothing I had ever seen or imagined–a stifling, low-ceilinged inferno of a cellar, red-lit from the fires, and deafening with oaths and the clanging of pots and pans. It was so hot that all the metal-work except the stoves had to be covered with cloth

<h4> The hotel allows us two litres of wine each

<h4> Like the waiter, he had grown more genial on seeing that I was willing to work

<h4> Idiot! Species of idiot! What’s the good of my finding you a job when you go and chuck it up the next moment? How could you be such a fool as to mention the other restaurant? You’d only to promise you would work for a month.’
‘It seemed more honest to say I might have to leave,’ I objected.
‘Honest! Honest! Who ever heard of a plongeur being honest? Mon ami’–suddenly he seized my lapel and spoke very earnestly–‘mon ami, you have worked here all day. You see what hotel work is like. Do you think a plongeur can afford a sense of honour?’

<h4> Later I realised how foolish it had been to have any scruples

<h1> Chapter XI

<h4> I calculated that one had to walk and run about fifteen miles during the day, and yet the strain of the work was more mental than physical

<h4> Mario was wonderful. The way he would stretch his great arms right across the cafeterie to fill a coffee-pot with one hand and boil an egg with the other, at the same time watching toast and shouting directions to the Magyar, and between whiles singing snatches from Rigoletto, was beyond all praise

<h4> I got up and went out, feeling as though my back were broken and my skull filled with hot cinders

<h4> It seemed that in the heat of those cellars, as in a Turkish bath, one could sweat out almost any quantity of drink. Plongeurs know this, and count on it. The power of swallowing quarts of wine, and then sweating it out before it can do much damage, is one of the compensations of their life

<h1> Chapter XII

<h4> yet he had earned his living since he was twelve, and worked his way up literally from the gutter. Crossing the Italian frontier without a passport, and selling chestnuts from a barrow on the northern boulevards, and being given fifty days’ imprisonment in London for working without a permit, and being made love to by a rich old woman in a hotel, who gave him a diamond ring and afterwards accused him of stealing it, were among his experiences

<h4> There sat the customers in all their splendour–spotless table-cloths, bowls of flowers, mirrors and gilt cornices and painted cherubim; and here, just a few feet away, we in our disgusting filth

<h4> Do you call yourself a waiter, you young bastard? You a waiter! You’re not fit to scrub floors in the brothel your mother came from

<h4> Words failing him, he turned to the door; and as he opened it he farted loudly, a favourite Italian insult.
Then he entered the dining-room and sailed across it dish in hand, graceful as a swan. Ten seconds later he was bowing reverently to a customer. And you could not help thinking, as you saw him bow and smile, with that benign smile of the trained waiter, that the customer was put to shame by having such an aristocrat to serve him.

<h4> This washing up was a thoroughly odious job–not hard, but boring and silly beyond words. It is dreadful to think that some people spend whole decades at such occupations

<h4> She gave out that she had once been an actress–actually, I imagine, a prostitute; most prostitutes end as charwomen.

<h1> Chapter XIII

<h4> Here, you, shave that moustache off at once! Nom de Dieu, who ever heard of a plongeur with a moustache?’
I began to protest, but he cut me short. ‘A plongeur with a moustache–nonsense! Take care I don’t see you with it tomorrow.’

<h4> Afterwards I found out the explanation of the custom, which is this: waiters in good hotels do not wear moustaches, and to show their superiority they decree that plongeurs shall not wear them either; and the cooks wear their moustaches to show their contempt for the waiters

<h4> all the discipline of the hotel depended on the manager. He was a conscientious man, and always on the lookout for slackness, but we were too clever for him. A system of service bells ran through the hotel, and the whole staff used these for signalling to one another. A long ring and a short ring, followed by two more long rings, meant that the manager was coming, and when we heard it we took care to look busy

<h4> Different jobs were done by different races. The office employees and the cooks and sewing-women were French, the waiters Italians and Germans (there is hardly such a thing as a French waiter in Paris), the plongeurs of every race in Europe, besides Arabs and negroes. French was the lingua franca, even the Italians speaking it to one another

<h4> He called himself a Greek, but in reality he was an Armenian. After knowing him I saw the force of the proverb ‘Trust a snake before a Jew and a Jew before a Greek, but don’t trust an Armenian

<h4> Well, what are you going to do about it? I’ve slept with your girl, slept with her three times. It was fine. What can you do, eh?’

<h4> ‘What the devil do you mean by smoking here?’ he cried.
‘What the devil do you mean by having a face like that?’ answered the Serbian, calmly.

<h4> Look here, mon vieux, they’ve got to pay me a day’s wages if I work up to midday, haven’t they? That’s the law. And where’s the sense of working after I get my wages? So I’ll tell you what I do. I go to a hotel and get a job as an extra, and up to midday I work hard. Then, the moment it’s struck twelve, I start raising such hell that they’ve no choice but to sack me. Neat, eh? Most days I’m sacked by half-past twelve; today it was two o’clock; but I don’t care, I’ve saved four hours’ work. The only trouble is, one can’t do it at the same hotel twice.’
It appeared that he had played this game at half the hotels and restaurants in Paris. It is probably quite an easy game to play during the summer, though the hotels protect themselves against it as well as they can by means of a black list

<h1> Chapter XIV

<h4> Hotel work is not particularly hard, but by its nature it comes in rushes and cannot be economised. You cannot, for instance, grill a steak two hours before it is wanted; you have to wait till the last moment, by which time a mass of other work has accumulated, and then do it all together, in frantic haste. The result is that at mealtimes everyone is doing two men’s work,

<h4> And yet the plongeurs, low as they are, also have a kind of pride. It is the pride of the drudge–the man who is equal to no matter what quantity of work. At that level, the mere power to go on working like an ox is about the only virtue attainable. Débrouillard is what every plongeur wants to be called. A débrouillard is a man who, even when he is told to do the impossible, will se débrouiller–get it done somehow.

<h4> Fourteen years underground had left him with about as much natural laziness as a piston rod.

<h4> Thus everyone in the hotel had his sense of honour, and when the press of work came we were all ready for a grand concerted effort to get through it

<h4> This is the good side of hotel work. In a hotel a huge and complicated machine is kept running by an inadequate staff, because every man has a well-defined job and does it scrupulously. But there is a weak point, and it is this–that the job the staff are doing is not necessarily what the customer pays for. The customer pays, as he sees it, for good service; the employee is paid, as he sees it, for the boulot–meaning, as a rule, an imitation of good service. The result is that, though hotels are miracles of punctuality, they are worse than the worst private houses in the things that matter.

<h4> Our cafeterie had year-old filth in all the dark corners, and the bread-bin was infested with cockroaches. Once I suggested killing these beasts to Mario. ‘Why kill the poor animals?’ he said reproachfully

<h4> In the kitchen the dirt was worse. It is not a figure of speech, it is a mere statement of fact to say that a French cook will spit in the soup–that is, if he is not going to drink it himself. He is an artist, but his art is not cleanliness

<h4> Roughly speaking, the more one pays for food, the more sweat and spittle one is obliged to eat with it.

<h4> A meal is simply ‘une commande’ to him, just as a man dying of cancer is simply ‘a case’ to the doctor

<h4> The only food at the Hôtel X. which was ever prepared cleanly was the staff’s, and the patron

<h4> Everywhere in the service quarters dirt festered–a secret vein of dirt, running through the great garish hotel like the intestines through a man’s body

<h4> But I imagine that the customers at the Hôtel X. were especially easy to swindle, for they were mostly Americans, with a sprinkling of English–no French–and seemed to know nothing whatever about good food. They would stuff themselves with disgusting American ‘cereals’, and eat marmalade at tea, and drink vermouth after dinner, and order a poulet à la reine at a hundred francs and then souse it in Worcester sauce. One customer, from Pittsburg, dined every night in his bedroom on grape-nuts, scrambled eggs and cocoa. Perhaps it hardly matters whether such people are swindled or not

<h1> Chapter XV

<h4> ‘In the afternoon of the fifth day I went half mad; at least, that’s how it seems to me now. There was an old faded print of a woman’s head hanging on the wall of my room, and I took to wondering who it could be; and after about an hour I realised that it must be Sainte Éloïse, who was the patron saint of the quarter. I had never taken any notice of the thing before, but now, as I lay staring at it, a most extraordinary idea came into my head.
‘“Écoute, mon cher

<h4> ‘I put in that about the candle, because I had heard that saints like having candles burnt in their honour. I meant to keep my promise, of course. But I am an atheist and I didn’t really believe that anything would come of it.

<h4> But, Jesus Christ, how good it was! As for the wine, I sucked it all down in one draught, and it seemed to go straight into my veins and flow round my body like new blood. Ah, that made a difference

<h4> Better!” I said. “I feel perfect! I’m not the same man as I was five minutes ago

<h4> ‘I had been praying to ——, the famous prostitute of the Empire…

<h4> Maria and I had a good laugh, and then we talked it over, and we made out that I didn’t owe Sainte Éloïse anything. Clearly it wasn’t she who had answered the prayer, and there was no need to buy her a candle. So I had my packet of cigarettes after all

<h1> Chapter XVI

<h4> introduced us to the woman who was to do the cooking, a Baltic Russian five feet tall and a yard across the hips

<h4> At a quarter to six one woke with a sudden start, tumbled into grease-stiffened clothes, and hurried out with dirty face and protesting muscles

<h4> The sky was like a vast flat wall of cobalt, with roofs and spires of black paper pasted upon it

<h4> After my first week at the hotel I always spent the afternoon interval in sleeping

<h4> Except for a few ambitious waiters who went to English classes, the whole staff wasted their leisure in this way; one seemed too lazy after the morning’s work to do anything better

<h4> Sometimes a woman would glance at Boris or me, and then, noticing our greasy clothes, look hastily away again

<h4> It was the typical life of a plongeur, and it did not seem a bad life at the time. I had no sensation of poverty, for even after paying my rent and setting aside enough for tobacco and journeys and my food on Sundays, I still had four francs a day for drinks, and four francs was wealth

<h4> There was–it is hard to express it–a sort of heavy contentment, the contentment a well-fed beast might feel, in a life which had become so simple. For nothing could be simpler than the life of a plongeur. He lives in a rhythm between work and sleep, without time to think, hardly conscious of the exterior world

<h4> Nothing is quite real to him but the boulot, drinks and sleep; and of these sleep is the most important

<h4> We were working people, and where was the sense of wasting sleep over a murder?

<h4> Work in the hotel taught me the true value of sleep, just as being hungry had taught me the true value of food. Sleep had ceased to be a mere physical necessity; it was something voluptuous, a debauch more than a relief

<h1> Chapter XVII

<h4> We had some jolly evenings, on Saturdays

<h4> Azaya, a great clumping peasant girl who worked fourteen hours a day in a glass factory, sang a song about, ‘Elle a perdu son pantalon, tout en dansant le Charleston.’

<h4> Charlie, drunk, half danced, half staggered to and fro with a glass of sham absinthe balanced in one fat hand, pinching the women’s breasts and declaiming poetry

<h4> Everyone was very happy, overwhelmingly certain that the world was a good place and we a notable set of people

<h4> queer thing about Fureux was that, though he was a Communist when sober, he turned violently patriotic when drunk. He started the evening with good Communist principles, but after four or five litres he was a rampant Chauvinist, denouncing spies, challenging all foreigners to fight, and, if he was not prevented, throwing bottles

<h4> Citizens of the Republic, I was wounded at Verdun——

<h4> We thought nothing in the world could be funnier than this speech of Fureux

<h4> Charlie, grown sober again, captured the conversation and talked about his soul for five minutes

<h4> We perceived that we were not splendid inhabitants of a splendid world, but a crew of underpaid workmen grown squalidly and dismally drunk

<h4> On the whole, the two hours when one was perfectly and wildly happy seemed worth the subsequent headache. For many men in the quarter, unmarried and with no future to think of, the weekly drinking-bout was the one thing that made life worth living.

<h1> Chapter XVIII

<h4> It happened at a time when I was hard up. You know what that is like–how damnable, that a man of refinement should ever be in such a condition

<h4> I was living with a girl at the time–Yvonne her name was–a great half-witted peasant girl

<h4> But to a man of intelligence nothing is impossible

<h4> To get money easily one must be a woman

<h1> Chapter XIX

<h4> Proud and lazy men do not make good waiters

<h4> Put that brush down, you fool! You and I belong to proud races; we don’t work for nothing, like these damned Russian serfs. I tell you, to be cheated like this is torture to me. There have been times in my life, when someone has cheated me even of five sous, when I have vomited – yes, vomited with rage

<h4> Besides, mon vieux, don’t forget that I’m a Communist. À bas les bourgeois! Did any man alive ever see me working when I could avoid it? No. And not only I don’t wear myself out working, like you other fools, but I steal, just to show my independence

<h4> It wasn’t that I wanted milk, you understand, because I hate the stuff; it was principle, just principle

<h1> Chapter XX

<h4> The patron would only allow us three candles in the kitchen, and the cook said three were unlucky, so we had only two

<h4> eight in the morning till midnight

<h4> and mine from seven in the morning till half-past twelve the next morning–seventeen and a half hours, almost without a break

<h4> Boris, who lived near by and had not to catch the last Metro home, worked from eight in the morning till two the next morning–eighteen hours a day, seven days a week. Such hours, though not usual, are nothing extraordinary in Paris.
Life settled at once

<h4> Those copper saucepans are the bane of a plongeur’s life

<h4> this way our incompetence piled one job on another throughout the day, everything in arrears

<h4> The cook would find time to talk about her artistic nature, and say did I not think Tolstoi was épatant

<h4> and sing in a fine soprano voice as she minced beef on the board

<h4> The cook’s vast buttocks banged against me as she moved to and fro

<h4> Unspeakable idiot! How many times have I told you not to bleed the beetroots

<h4> Mon Dieu, why did they send me an idiot for a plongeur

<h4> except that about eleven the cook usually had a crise de nerfs and a flood of tears

<h4> By five the cook and I were feeling unsteady on our feet, not having eaten or sat down since seven. We used to collapse, she on the dustbin and I on the floor, drink a bottle of beer, and apologise for some of the things we had said in the morning

<h4> never had she thought to come to such a life as this; her nerves would not stand it; she had studied music at Vienna; she had a bedridden husband to support, etc. etc

<h4> His sole job, besides ordering the supplies, was to stand in the bar smoking cigarettes and looking gentlemanly, and he did that to perfection

<h4> Generally I was in bed by half-past one. Sometimes I missed the train and had to sleep on the floor of the restaurant, but it hardly mattered, for I could have slept on cobblestones at that time

<h1> Chapter XXI

<h4> I could have saved an hour a day by taking a room near the restaurant, but it seemed impossible to find time to change lodgings–or

<h4> After ten days I managed to find a free quarter of an hour

<h4> There was a girl in a bistro near my hotel who worked from seven in the morning till midnight for a whole year, only sitting down to her meals. I remember once asking her to come to a dance, and she laughed and said that she had not been further than the street corner for several months. She was consumptive, and died about the time I left Paris

<h4> Get me down that saucepan, idiot!’ the cook would cry (she was not tall enough to reach the shelves where the saucepans were kept). ‘Get it down yourself, you old whore,’ I would answer

<h4> at last, in pure spite, I lifted the dustbin up and put it out in the middle of the floor, where she was bound to trip over it.
‘Now, you cow,’ I said, ‘move it yourself.’
Poor old woman, it was too heavy for her to lift, and she sat down, put her head on the table and burst out crying. And I jeered at her

<h4> He had a curious, malignant spirit. He told me, as a matter of pride, that he had sometimes wrung a dirty dishcloth into a customer’s soup before taking it in, just to be revenged upon a member of the bourgeoisie

<h4> Looking round that filthy room, with raw meat lying among the refuse on the floor, and cold, clotted saucepans sprawling everywhere, and the sink blocked and coated with grease, I used to wonder whether there could be a restaurant in the world as bad as ours. But the other three all said that they had been in dirtier places

<h4> Sharp knives, of course, are the secret of a successful restaurant

<h4> restaurant. I am glad that this happened, for it destroyed one of my illusions, namely, the idea that Frenchmen know good food when they see

<h4> In a very few days after I had written to B. he replied to say that there was a job he could get for me. It was to look after a congenital imbecile, which sounded a splendid rest cure after the Auberge de Jehan Cottard. I pictured myself loafing in the country lanes, knocking thistle-heads off with my stick, feeding on roast lamb and treacle tart, and sleeping ten hours a night in sheets smelling of lavender

<h1> Chapter XXII

<h4> they have simply been trapped by a routine which makes thought impossible

<h4> They are supposed to provide luxury, but in reality they provide only a cheap, shoddy imitation of it. Nearly everyone hates hotels

<h4> Some restaurants are better than others, but it is impossible to get as good a meal in a restaurant as one can get, for the same expense, in a private house

<h4> Essentially, a ‘smart’ hotel is a place where a hundred people toil like devils in order that two hundred may pay through the nose for things they do not really want

<h4> A slave, Marcus Cato said, should be working when he is not sleeping. It does not matter whether his work is needed or not, he must work, because work in itself is good–for slaves, at least

<h4> So, dear brothers, since evidently you must sweat to pay for our trips to Italy, sweat and be damned to you

<h4> Possibly he does not like his fellow rich very much, but he supposes that even the vulgarest of them are less inimical to his pleasures, more his kind of people, than the poor, and that he had better stand by them

<h4> It is this fear of a supposedly dangerous mob that makes nearly all intelligent people conservative in their opinions

<h4> Fear of the mob is a superstitious fear. It is based on the idea that there is some mysterious, fundamental difference between rich and poor, as though they were two different races, like negroes and white men.

<h4> and the average millionaire is only the average dishwasher dressed in a new suit.

<h4> But the trouble is that intelligent, cultivated people, the very people who might be expected to have liberal opinions, never do mix with the poor. For what do the majority of educated people know about poverty

<h1> Chapter XXIII

<h4> he tells me that he is making a hundred francs a day and has set up a girl who is très serieuse and never smells of garlic

<h4> His bowels yearned at the thought of getting, perhaps, fifty thousand francs’ profit, and yet he could not bring himself to risk the money. He used to sit in a corner with his head in his hands, groaning and sometimes yelling out in agony, and often he would kneel down (he was very pious) and pray for strength, but still he couldn’t do

<h4> Three days later he had some kind of stroke, and in a fortnight he was dead–of a broken heart, Charlie said.

<h1> Chapter XXIV

<h4> Of the women, not a single one has washed her face this morning

<h4> potatoes properly cooked

<h4> England is a very good country when you are not poor;

<h4> The thought of not being poor made me very patriotic

<h4> trousers. It was, at any rate, notoriously impossible to starve in London, so there was nothing to be anxious about

<h4> The fourth shopman was a large blond young man, very pink all over, like a slice of ham

<h4> had worn bad enough things before, but nothing at all like these; they were not merely dirty and shapeless, they had–how is one to express it?–a gracelessness, a patina of antique filth, quite different from mere shabbiness. They were the sort of clothes you see on a bootlace seller, or a tramp

<h4> My new clothes had put me instantly into a new world. Everyone’s demeanour seemed to have changed abruptly

<h4> For the first time I noticed, too, how the attitude of women varies with a man’s clothes. When a badly dressed man passes them they shudder away from him with a quite frank movement of disgust, as though he were a dead cat

<h4> When I got into the bed I found that it was as hard as a board, and as for the pillow, it was a mere hard cylinder like a block of wood. It was rather worse than sleeping on a table, because the bed was not six feet long, and very narrow, and the mattress was convex, so that one had to hold on to avoid falling out. The sheets stank so horribly of sweat that I could not bear them near my nose. Also, the bedclothes only consisted of the sheets and a cotton counterpane, so that though stuffy it was none too warm

<h4> Another man, victim of bladder disease, got up and noisily used his chamber-pot half a dozen times during the night

<h4> In a corner by himself a Jew, muzzle down in the plate, was guiltily wolfing bacon.

<h4> The Irishman was a friendly old man, but he smelt very unpleasant, which was not surprising when one learned how many diseases he suffered from

<h4> With this assemblage of diseases he had tramped the roads for fifteen years.

<h4> ‘And you, my boy, how long is it since you knelt down and spoke with your Father in Heaven?’

<h4> He could pronounce the words ‘the dear Lord Jesus’ with less shame than anyone I ever saw. No doubt he had learned the knack in prison

<h4> Bareheaded, we knelt down among the dirty teacups and began to mumble that we had left undone those things that we ought to have done, and done those things that we ought not to have done, and there was no health in us

<h1> Chapter XXVII

<h4> He said that his wife had promptly deserted him when he lost his job, and he had been so long away from women that he had almost forgotten what they were like

<h4> him. I believe that he was a typical tramp and there are tens of thousands in England like him

<h4> Nevertheless, one would have known him for a tramp a hundred yards away. There was something in his drifting style of walk, and the way he had of hunching his shoulders forward, essentially abject. Seeing him walk, you felt instinctively that he would sooner take a blow than give one.

<h4> Best leave it. It don’t do a man no good to steal. T’ank God, I ain’t never stolen nothin’ yet.’

<h4> His ignorance was limitless and appalling

<h4> He told me once that he had not had to do with a woman for two years–since he had lost his job, that is–and he had forgotten that one could aim higher than prostitutes. He had the regular character of a tramp–abject, envious, a jackal’s character

<h4> He was probably capable of work too, if he had been well fed for a few months. But two years of bread and margarine had lowered his standards hopelessly. He had lived on this filthy imitation of food till his whole mind and body were compounded of inferior stuff. It was malnutrition and not any native vice that had destroyed his manhood

<h1> Chapter XXIX

<h4> there was a man near us who had some nervous trouble, shell-shock perhaps, which made him cry out ‘Pip!’ at irregular intervals. It was a loud, startling noise, something like the toot of a small motor-horn. You never knew when it was coming, and it was a sure preventer of sleep

<h4> The dormitory was dark and close, with fifteen beds in it. There was a horrible hot reek of urine, so beastly that at first one tried to breathe in small shallow puffs, not filling one’s lungs to the bottom

<h4> Do you know what my friends say to me? They say, “M——, you are past redemption.” Quite true, I am past redemption

<h1> Chapter XXX

<h4> He was kneeling on the pavement with a box of chalks, copying a sketch of Winston Churchill from a penny note-book. The likeness was not at all bad

<h4> I’m what they call a serious screever. I don’t draw in blackboard chalks like these others, I use proper colours the same as what painters use; bloody expensive they are, especially the reds. I use five bobs’ worth of colours in a long day, and never less than two bobs’ worth.1 Cartoons is my line–you know, politics and cricket and that. Look here’–he showed me his note-book–‘here’s likenesses of all the political blokes, what I’ve copied from the papers. I have a different cartoon every

<h4> You see that silly old fool? He’s bin doing the same picture every day for ten years. “A faithful friend” he calls it. It’s of a dog pulling a child out of the water. The silly old bastard can’t draw any better than a child of ten. He’s learned just that one picture by rule of thumb, like you learn to put a puzzle together. There’s a lot of that sort about here

<h4> Bozo limped slowly, with a queer crab-like gait, half sideways, dragging his smashed foot behind him

<h4> Say, will you look at Aldebaran! Look at the colour. Like a——great blood orange

<h4> I confessed that I did not know which Aldebaran was–indeed, I had never even noticed that the stars were of different colours

<h4> The stars are a free show; it don’t cost anything to use your eyes

<h4> Look at Paddy–a tea-swilling old moocher, only fit to scrounge for fag-ends. That’s the way most of them go. I despise them. But you don’t need get like that. If you’ve got any education, it don’t matter to you if you’re on the road for the rest of your life

<h4> Well, I’ve found just the contrary,’ I said. ‘It seems to me that when you take a man’s money away he’s fit for nothing from that moment.’
‘No, not necessarily. If you set yourself to it, you can live the same life, rich or poor. You can still keep on with your books and your ideas. You just got to say to yourself, “I’m a free man in here”’–he tapped his forehead–‘and you’re all right

<h4> he had been doing well in Paris, saving money, and engaged to a French girl. One day the girl was crushed to death under the wheels of an omnibus. Bozo went on the drink for a week, and then returned to work, rather shaky; the same morning he fell from a stage on which he was working, forty feet onto the pavement, and smashed his right foot to pulp. For some reason he received only sixty pounds compensation. He returned to England, spent his money in looking for jobs, tried hawking books in Middlesex Street market, then tried selling toys from a tray, and finally settled down as a screever. He had lived hand to mouth ever since, half starved throughout the winter, and often sleeping in the spike or on the Embankment

<h4> There was, clearly, no future for him but beggary and a death in the workhouse

<h4> With all this, he had neither fear, nor regret, nor shame, nor self-pity. He had faced his position, and made a philosophy for himself. Being a beggar, he said, was not his fault, and he refused either to have any compunction about it or to let it trouble him

<h4> He considered himself in a class above the ordinary run of beggars, who, he said, were an abject lot, without even the decency to be ungrateful

<h4> Have you ever seen a corpse burned? I have, in India. They put the old chap on the fire, and the next moment I almost jumped out of my skin, because he’d started kicking. It was only his muscles contracting in the heat–still, it give me a turn. Well, he wriggled about for a bit like a kipper on hot coals, and then his belly blew up and went off with a bang you could have heard fifty yards away. It fair put me against cremation

<h4> You fell on one foot, my man. And bloody lucky for you you didn’t fall on both feet,” he says. “Because if you had of fallen on both feet you’d have shut up like a bloody concertina, and your thigh bones’d be sticking out of your ears!

<h4> Clearly the phrase was not the doctor’s but Bozo’s own. He had a gift for phrases. He had managed to keep his brain intact and alert, and so nothing could make him succumb to poverty. He might be ragged and cold, or even starving, but so long as he could read, think and watch for meteors, he was, as he said, free in his own mind

<h4> He was an embittered atheist (the sort of atheist who does not so much disbelieve in God as personally dislike Him

<h4> A beggar works by standing out of doors in all weathers and getting varicose veins, chronic bronchitis, etc. It is a trade like any other; quite useless, of course–but, then, many reputable trades are quite useless. And as a social type a beggar compares well with scores of others. He is honest compared with the sellers of most patent medicines, high-minded compared with a Sunday newspaper proprietor, amiable compared with a hire-purchase tout–in short, a parasite, but a fairly harmless parasite. He seldom extracts more than a bare living from the community, and, what should justify him according to our ethical ideas, he pays for it over and over in suffering. I do not think there is anything about a beggar that sets him in a different class from other people, or gives most modern men the right to despise him

<h1> Chapter XXXII

<h4> The Cockney accent as we know it seems to have come up in the ’forties (it is first mentioned in an American book, Herman Melville’s White Jacket), and Cockney is already changing; there are few people now who say ‘fice’ for ‘face’, ‘nawce’ for ‘nice’ and so forth as consistently as they did twenty years ago

<h4> For example, twenty years ago the London working classes habitually used the word ‘bloody’. Now they have abandoned it utterly, though novelists still represent them as using it. No born Londoner (it is different with people of Scotch or Irish origin) now says ‘bloody’, unless he is a man of some education. The word has, in fact, moved up in the social scale and ceased to be a swear word for the purposes of the working classes

<h4> swearing, is mysterious. Of its very nature swearing is as irrational as magic–indeed, it is a species of magic. But there is also a paradox about it, namely this: Our intention in swearing is to shock and wound, which we do by mentioning something that should be kept secret–usually something to do with the sexual functions. But the strange thing is that when a word is well established as a swear word, it seems to lose its original meaning; that is, it loses the thing that made it into a swear word. A word becomes an oath because it means a certain thing, and, because it has become an oath, it ceases to mean that thing. For example, ‘fuck’. The Londoners do not now use, or very seldom use, this word in its original meaning; it is on their lips from morning till night, but it is a mere expletive and means nothing

<h4> The rule seems to be that words accepted as swear words have some magical character, which sets them apart and makes them useless for ordinary conversation

<h4> Evidently a word is an insult simply because it is meant as an insult, without reference to its dictionary meaning

<h1> Chapter XXXIII

<h4> The tramps treated the service as a purely comic spectacle. It was, indeed, a sufficiently ludicrous service–the kind where there are sudden yells of ‘Hallelujah!’ and endless extempore prayers–but their behaviour passed all bounds

<h4> It was a queer, rather disgusting scene. Below were the handful of simple, well-meaning people, trying hard to worship; and above were the hundred men whom they had fed, deliberately making worship impossible

<h4> It was our revenge upon them for having humiliated us by feeding us

<h4> ‘I shall address the last five minutes of my sermon to the unsaved sinners!

<h4> It seemed that his whole life was this – a round of mooching, drunks and lay-ups. He laughed as he talked of it, taking it all for a tremendous joke

<h4> Bella was young and Bella was fair
With bright blue eyes and golden hair,
O unhappy Bella!
Her step was light and her heart was gay,
But she had no sense, and one fine day
She got herself put in the family way
By a wicked, heartless, cruel deceiver.
Poor Bella was young, she didn’t believe
That the world is hard and men deceive,
O unhappy Bella!
She said, ‘My man will do what’s just,
He’ll marry me now, because he must’;
Her heart was full of loving trust
In a wicked, heartless, cruel deceiver.
She went to his house; that dirty skunk
Had packed his bags and done a bunk,
O unhappy Bella!
Her landlady said, ‘Get out, you whore,
I won’t have your sort a-darkening my door.’
Poor Bella was put to affliction sore
By a wicked, heartless, cruel deceiver.
All night she tramped the cruel snows,
What she must have suffered nobody knows,
O unhappy Bella!
And when the morning dawned so red,
Alas, alas, poor Bella was dead,
Sent so young to her lonely bed
By a wicked, heartless, cruel deceiver.
So thus, you see, do what you will,
The fruits of sin are suffering still,
O unhappy Bella!
As into the grave they laid her low,
The men said, ‘Alas, but life is so,’
But the women chanted, sweet and low,
‘It’s all the men, the dirty bastards!’

<h4> They had quarrelled overnight (there was some silly casus belli about one saying to the other, ‘Bullshit’, which was taken for Bolshevik–a deadly insult

<h4> Thank you,’ said the woman bitterly, ‘when I want to get mixed up with a set of tramps, I’ll let you know.’
I enjoyed the way she said tramps. It seemed to show you in a flash the whole of her soul; a small, blinkered, feminine soul, that had learned absolutely nothing from years on the road. She was, no doubt, a respectable widow woman, become a tramp through some grotesque accident

<h4> Well, that’s bloody bad luck, guv’nor

<h4> So powerful is the word ‘gentleman’ in an old soldier’s ear.

<h4> They have to do it,’ he said. ‘If they made these places too comfortable, you’d have all the scum of the country flocking into them. It’s only the bad food as keeps all that scum away. These here tramps are too lazy to work, that’s all that’s wrong with them. You don’t want to go encouraging of them. They’re scum

<h4> It was interesting to see the subtle way in which he disassociated himself from ‘these here tramps’. He had been on the road six months, but in the sight of God, he seemed to imply, he was not a tramp. I

<h4> Our dormitory was a barn-like room with thirty beds close together, and a tub to serve as a common chamber-pot

<h1> Chapter XXXVI

<h4> Tramps are cut off from women, in the first place, because there are very few women at their level of society. One might imagine that among destitute people the sexes would be as equally balanced as elsewhere. But it is not so; in fact, one can almost say that below a certain level society is entirely male

<h4> It will be seen from these figures that at the charity-level men outnumber women by something like ten to one. The cause is presumably that unemployment affects women less than men; also that any presentable woman can, in the last resort, attach herself to some man. The result, for a tramp, is that he is condemned to perpetual celibacy. For of course it goes without saying that if a tramp finds no women at his own level, those above–even a very little above–are as far out of his reach as the moon

<h4> He lives a fantastically disagreeable life, and lives it to no purpose whatever

<h4> whatever. One could not, in fact, invent a more futile routine than walking from prison to prison, spending perhaps eighteen hours a day in the cell and on the road

<h4> The law keeps this process going, and we have got so accustomed to it that we are not surprised. But it is very silly.

<h4> The problem is how to turn the tramp from a bored, half-alive vagrant into a self-respecting human being

<h4> It must be remembered that under the present system tramps are as dead a loss to the country as they could possibly be, for they not only do no work, but they live on a diet that is bound to undermine their health; the system, therefore, loses lives as well as money. A scheme which fed them decently, and made them produce at least a part of their own food, would be worth trying

<h4> By degrees, if the scheme worked well, they might even cease to be regarded as paupers, and be able to marry and take a respectable place in society

<h4> For the question is, what to do with men who are underfed and idle; and the answer–to make them grow their own food–imposes itself automatically.
